## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your machine.
- [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), the Rust package manager.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/komangkrisnanda/rust-wrap-api.git
cd rust-wrap-api
```

### Running the API

To run the API server, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run
```

This will start the server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running and listening on a specific port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:8000).

### Building the Project

To build the project, use:

```sh
cargo build
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests for the project, use:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified in your configuration).

Refer to the [API Documentation](docs/api.md) for detailed information on available endpoints and their usage.
